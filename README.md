Phishing Website Detection Using Machine Learning pose a growing threat by mimicking legitimate sites to steal sensitive information like passwords and financial details. As online transactions increase, the need for reliable detection methods becomes critical. This project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately classify phishing websites. The model will use 30 features, such as URL structure and domain information, to output a binary classification: 1 for legitimate websites and -1 for phishing sites.
